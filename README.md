Solidity Error Handling Demo
This Solidity program demonstrates error handling mechanisms and access control within a smart contract. It showcases the use of require, assert, and conditional statements for handling exceptions and ensuring specific users have access to certain functions.

Description
The "error" contract keeps track of a count variable and restricts access to certain functions based on the caller's identity. The contract owner is set during deployment.

Functions
Require: Increments the count and allows only the contract owner to execute the function using the require statement.

Assert: Increments the count and verifies the caller's identity using the assert statement. The transaction is reverted if conditions are not met.

Rivert: Increments the count and checks if the caller is the owner. If not, the transaction is reverted with an error message. If the count exceeds 3, the transaction is also reverted.

Getting Started
To run this program, follow these steps:

Go to the Remix website.

Create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., error_handling.sol).

Copy and paste the code from the provided Solidity file (error_handling.sol) into your new file.

In the "Solidity Compiler" tab, ensure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.4" or another compatible version. Click on the "Compile .sol" button.

Switch to the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab. Select the "error" contract from the dropdown menu and click the "Deploy" button.

Once deployed, interact with the contract by calling its functions through the UI.

Usage
Require Function: Increments the count. Only the contract owner can execute this function.

Assert Function: Increments the count. Caller's identity is verified; transaction is reverted if conditions are not met.

Rivert Function: Increments the count. Checks caller identity and count value. Reverts transaction if caller is not the owner or count exceeds 3.

Note
This is a simplified demonstration of error handling and access control in Solidity. In actual smart contracts, ensure to consider comprehensive security measures and thoroughly test your code before deploying it to the Ethereum network.
